- **Battery optimization**: Utilizes Android's best practices to minimize battery consumption while running location services.
- **Foreground service**: Ensures the app remains active with a foreground notification when tracking the location.
- **Background permissions**: Implements the necessary permissions for background location access following Android's privacy guidelines.
- **Kotlin and Java integration**: Leverages the power of Kotlin and Java to build the app with clean, maintainable code.
